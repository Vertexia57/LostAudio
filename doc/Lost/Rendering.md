# Rendering Engine

There are 2 rendering engines that Lost has inbuilt, `Renderer2D` and `Renderer3D`
These two renderers do much different things, and are specially optimised for each task
## 2D Renderer
## 3D Renderer
# Materials

Lost uses **Materials**, unlike most c++ engines.
Materials have a set **shader**, **texture list** and **uniforms**.

Here's a quick example
```cpp

```
# Shaders
# Batching
# Post Processing Shaders
